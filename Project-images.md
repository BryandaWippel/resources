Images from lab projects.

Listed as link to images and brief description.

[*O. lurida* gonad histology](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_Kednl1tNImYW1oaGU2MENla0U?usp=sharing) part 1 from Laura Spencer's oysters. Images are labeled according to population, individual number, and magnification. Hi represents 40x, lo represents 4x magnification. 

[*C. gigas* gonad histology](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_Kednl1tNImX0MyY0tTdlBrRjg?usp=sharing) from Yaamini Venkataraman's oysters. Images are labeled as Gigas, individual number, and magnification. Hi represents 40x, lo represents 4x magnification.

[*C. gigas* oyster seed morphology](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_Kednl1tNImWTJLYUxHVzA0eWs?usp=sharing) from Rhonda Elliot's oysters. Images are labeled as T#, where the number respresents the silo along with the screen size range that was sampled. Images were used to measure length of oyster seed using ImageJ, and measured oysters are labeled with numbers.

[*C. gigas* oyster seed morphology](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_Kednl1tNImN0ZvM0FYLWxXYVk?usp=sharing) sampled on separate days from Rhonda Elliot's oysters. Images are separated into folders by silo number and day number. Within the folders, images are labeled according to silo number, day number, and oyster individual numbers. Images were used to measure length of oyster seed using ImageJ, and measured oysters are labeled with numbers. 

[Geoduck *Panopea generosa* gonad histology](https://figshare.com/articles/Reproductive_Maturation_in_Geoduck_clams_Panopea_generosa_/3205975) and reproductive maturation stages from Grace Crandall's capstone project.

### Ethanol Precipitation (DNA)

---

1. Add 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAC (pH=5.2) to sample.

2. Invert tube several times to mix.

3. Add 2 volumes (based on initial sample volume) of ice cold 100% EtOH to sample.

4. Invert tube several times to mix.

5. Incubate @ -80C for at least 30 mins. Can go longer if desired.

6. Centrifuge at highspeed (~16,000g) @ 4C (or room temperature) for 15 mins to pellet DNA.

7. Discard supernatant.

8. Wash pellet with 70% EtOH.

9. Spin 5 mins. at highspeed (~16,000g) @ 4C (or room temperature) to re-pellet DNA.

10. Repeat the 70% EtOH wash/pelleting steps.

11. CAREFULLY remove all supernatant.

12. Air dry pellet for 5 mins (do not exceed this, as it make dissolving DNA pellet difficult).

13. Resuspend DNA pellet in appropriate volume of water or Qiagen EB (10mM Tris-HCl, pH=7.5)

*Putting on your PPE first, lab coat, protective glasses and gloves*

*Put the waste container in the sink next to the instrument*

Starting the instrument

1. 1)Turn on the Laptop next to the titrator, 
2. 2)Turn the titrator ON (front switch)
3. 3)Turn the Rondolino (arm) ON (back switch)
4. 4)Press the left blue button on top of the Rondolino arm
5. 5)Take DI cup out from position zero
6. 6)Place the empty acid cup in position zero
7. 7)Press the left blue button on top of the Rondolino arm
8. 8)We want to purge the line from the acid bottle to the instrument. You want to make sure that there is NO BUBBLES in the line
9. 9)Open the software LabX
10. 10)To PURGE, on the main screen of the instrument click PURGE, click START. Repeat this process 3 times and be certain that there is no bubbles left in the line
11. 11)After the purging cycle, press the left blue button, remove the acid cup
12. 12)PUT THE ACID BACK in the brown bottle, open the cap and carefully dumped the acid back in the bottle
13. 13)ADD fresh DI water to the DI cup place in position zero and press on the left blue button once more
14. 14)Plugging in the bubbler into the wall outlet, it turns the bubbler ON
15. 15)Prepare the logging sheet of the day; enter the date, CRM batch number

Calibration

1. 1)Place each buffers 4, 7 , 10 in their respective cups and place the cups in position 1, 2 and 3
2. 2)CAREFULLY open the gray cap on the pH probe, add KCL if needed
3. 3)Insert the probe in the left back side of the arm, behind the Temperature Sensor, make sure that the Tip of the pH sensor DO NOT touch anything
4. 4)On the LABX main page, click on the analysis (bottom left of the screen), click once on the calibration, click on the green start button at the top of the screen, select TitratorSorte, click on start again
5. 5)On the LABX main page, top left you can click on the Work Bench, it will show the sample being measured
6. 6)FOR THE BUFFERS a variation between 0 and 0.3 is acceptable. If it is greater than that, use newer buffers and repeat the calibration process
7. 7)When the calibration is completed, on the LABX mainsheet, open the DATA and click on MY LATEST RESULTS
8. 8)In the results details section you will have the values for the slope and zero point, record this on the logging sheet
9. 9)In the measured values section you will have the results pH 4,7,10 record these values on the logging sheet
10. 10)Record the temperature of the buffers measured during the calibration
11. 11)Refer to the calculation and recording data section before going any further
12. 12)Remove the buffers and put them back in their respective container
13. 13)Put the empty cups in the sink

Calculation and recording data

1. 1)On the desktop open the pH calibration excel sheet
2. 2)On the CALIBRATION sheet, Highlight from the date row all the way to the end of the graph, COPY and PASTE lower
3. 3)In the copied portion, enter today&#39;s date, the new values from the pH (the ones on the logging sheet), graph the new data and use the slope term to calculate the pH values of 3 and 3.5
4. 4)Record the pH values for 3.5 and 3 on the logging sheet
5. 5)On the LOG sheet, you can now enter the values for all the pH, the slope and zero point and the temperature
6. 6)On the CRM sheet you can enter the date, batch #, CRM batch
7. 7)You can also prepare the folder for the analysis, on the desktop open the TAcalculations folder
8. 8)In the DATA folder, create a new folder, with name of the samples and date, a name that will help you identify easily the samples you are measuring
9. 9)In that folder, create two more folders: Mass and TitrationFiles
10. 10)In the Mass folder create an excel spreadsheet with two columns, in column A you will enter the sample names and column B titled Mass you will enter the weight of the samples. Save it as an CSV file, this is really important and named: Mass08012016 for example (Mass plus the date without any space in the name)
11. 11)In the TitrationFiles folder you will put the results from the titrator for each samples always save the files as CSV
12. 12)Open R, you only need to change the files name for the path and massfile (row 20 and 21)   the date (row 23)  and the values for pH 3.5 and pH 3 (row 26 and 27) DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE and at the end of the day DO NOT SAVE THE R file

Measuring the CRM sample

1. 1)Using the serological pipet, measured between 99.5 and 100.5 g of CRM in a cup
2. 2)Record the mass on the logging sheet
3. 3)Insert the cup in the position 1 in the roulette
4. 4)On the LABX mainsheet highlight the CSUN option, this is the correct method to measure samples
5. 5)Click on start
6. 6)Click on TitratorSorte
7. 7)On the next page enter the number of samples you are running, in this case 1
8. 8)Enter the name of the sample CRM
9. 9)Enter the weight of the sample and press OK
10. 10)Open the workbench sheet to see the sample being measured
11. 11)Enter the time of the beginning of the analysis on the logging sheet
12. 12)It will take about 12 minutes
13. 13)At the end, on the main page open the results and click on the most recent result sets
14. 14)Under the measured values, close the graph and open the sheet with the values, click on the second set of double values
15. 15)Right click on the mouse and copy all as a text
16. 16)Open a new excel sheet, paste the values and save it as a CSV file in the TitrationFiles folder with the name of the sample, it would be like CRM.csv
17. 17)In the Mass folder in your current mass excel spreadsheet ex: Mass08012016 enter the weight of the CRM samples
18. 18)In the R program click on source and a new excel sheet will appear in your data folder of the day
19. 19)In the excel sheet you will have the TA value of the CRM
20. 20)Enter the CRM value on the logging sheet
21. 21)Enter the CRM value on the pHCalibration excel sheet in the CRMsheet, calculate the %off, anything less than +/- 1% it is acceptable between the measured value and the actual value of the CRM batch
22. 22)You are now ready to start processing samples
23. 23)The samples are processed the same way as the CRM, refer to steps 1 through 18 in the measuring the CRM sample section
24. 24)The only difference is you can add up to 9 samples
25. 25)Once the samples have been analyzed, dump the waste in the waste container in the sink
26. 26)Rinse all the cups with DI water and let them dry on the hanging rack above the sink
27. 27)All the solid waste (serological pipet, and paper towels used to soak a big spill from a samples or CRM) can be dumped in the cardboard box next to fume hood

Recommendations

1. 1)When beginning a new series of samples, doing duplicate of the first 5 samples is recommended
2. 2)When unsure please ask G or Nyssa for help

- Sterile 1.7mL snap-cap microfuge tubes ([Genesee: 22-281S](https://geneseesci.com/shop-online/product-details/?product=22-281S))
- Microfuge (capable of 10,000g)
- Thermal cycler, water bath, or heating block capable of 37C.
- ice

#### Procedure
##### Total Time: ~ 1.5 - 2.0hrs
##### Cost/sample: ~ $2.00
1. Read the manufacturer's [Turbo DNA-free <em>rigorous</em> protocol](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Ambion_Turbo_DNA_Free.pdf).
2. Read <em>this</em> protocol.
3. Verify sufficient quantities/availability of reagents/equipment.
4. Wear clean gloves and change gloves frequently.
5. Thaw RNA on ice.
6. Reaction volume will be 50uL.
7. Transfer desired quantity of RNA to a 0.5mL tube, but no more than 2ug and no more than 44uL.
8. Adjust RNA volume in 0.5mL tube to 44uL with nuclease-free H2O (supplied in kit).
9. Add 0.1 volumes (5uL) of 10x Turbo DNase Buffer.
10. Add 1uL of Turbo DNase. Mix by <em>gently</em> flicking tube. If needed, spot spin for no more than 2s to collect liquid from sides of tube.
11. Incubate @ 37C for 1hr.
12. Repeat steps 10 & 11.
13. Vortex DNase Inactivation reagent for 10s.
14. Add 0.2 volumes (10.2uL) of DNase Inactivation to the RNA.
15. Incubate @ RT for 2mins with occasional mixing.
16. Place 0.5mL tube in an empty 1.7mL tube and centrifuge 10,000g for 1.5mins @ RT.
17. Transfer supernatant to sterile 1.7mL tube. Do not transfer <em>any</em> inactivation reagent. If some is transferred, repeat steps 16 & 17.
18. Keep sample on ice for short-term storage (i.e. no more than 2hrs) or store @ -80C.
